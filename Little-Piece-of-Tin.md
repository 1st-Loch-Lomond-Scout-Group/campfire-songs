# Little Piece of Tin

I'm a little piece of tin,
Nobody knows where I have been.
Got four wheels **_(Holds up 4 fingers)_** and a running board **_(Make a woosh with hand)_**,
I’m a four door **_(Holds up 4 fingers)_**, I’m a Ford

## Chorus x2

Toot toot **_(Flat hand like your beeping a car horn)_**,
Rattle rattle **_(Shake your hips)_**,
Crash **_(Clap hands)_**,
Beep beep **_(Touches nose twice)_**,
