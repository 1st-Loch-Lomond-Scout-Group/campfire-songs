# Little Piece of Tin

## About

## Song Text (Version 1)

I'm a little piece of tin **_(Points at self)_**,  
Nobody knows where I have been **_(Shrugs shoulders)_**.  
Got four wheels **_(Holds up 4 fingers)_** and a running board **_(Make a woosh with hand)_**,  
I’m a four door **_(Holds up 4 fingers)_**, I’m a Ford!

### Chorus (Repeat Twice)

Toot toot **_(Flat hand like your beeping a car horn)_**,  
Rattle rattle **_(Shake your hips)_**,  
Crash **_(Clap hands)_**,  
Beep beep! **_(Touches nose twice)_**

## Song Text (Version 2)

I'm a little piece of tin **_(Points at self)_**,  
Nobody what shape I am in **_(Shrugs shoulders)_**.  
Got four wheels **_(Holds up 4 fingers)_** and a running board **_(Make a woosh with hand)_**,  
I’m not a Chevy and I’m not a Ford!

### Chorus (Repeat Twice)

Toot toot **_(Flat hand like your beeping a car horn)_**,  
Rattle rattle **_(Shake your hips)_**,  
Crash **_(Clap hands)_**,  
Beep beep! **_(Touches nose twice)_**
