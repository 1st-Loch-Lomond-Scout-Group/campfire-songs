# Little Piece of Tin

I'm a little piece of tin,
Nobody knows where I have been.
Got four wheels and a running board,
I’m a four door, I’m a Ford

## Chorus

Toot toot, rattle rattle, shake, beep beep,
Toot toot, rattle rattle, shake, beep beep,
Toot toot, rattle rattle, shake, beep beep,
Toot toot!
